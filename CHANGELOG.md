# Changelog

## 0.1.23

- Repo admission compares the declared agent env, not the session env a turn applied, so a normal turn no longer causes a false `rejected_config`.
- `status.json` carries `receipt`: PID, release, source dir, `status_unix` of the same snapshot and
  `cfg_sha256` over the stable serialization of the in-memory `RunnerConfig` (resolved defaults; fields
  declared `repr=False` and secret-named fields excluded). A disk edit does not move it until the held
  cfg is replaced by a restart; a serialization failure writes `receipt.error` with no digest.
  Scope and reproduction: `docs/config-receipt.md`.

## 0.1.22

- Preserve reviewed WAIT intent and access recovery in one integrated path.
- Hold unlaunchable sessions before spawning them.
- Persist the auth-recovery wake so it survives a restart.
- Resume the native session on a proven same-path workspace restore.

## 0.1.21

- Add the opt-in `receipt_wait_v1` receipt WAIT (`⏳ WAIT receipt:#<card8>`): a durable operator-armed registration with per-journal cursors wakes the card once on the first new accepted correlated Telegram text receipt; `mesh-runner receipt-wait arm|inspect|disarm|rebaseline` (docs/receipt-wait.md).
- Accept Git numeric collision admin names for exactly owned legacy worktree slots while preserving ownership and reciprocal path checks.
- Reconcile newer corroborated owner card WAIT intent without waking a stale target or taking over its dependency.
- Preserve durable capability holds and release them only through authenticated exact-binding access recovery with fresh own probes; support the configured native permission-grant notifier.
